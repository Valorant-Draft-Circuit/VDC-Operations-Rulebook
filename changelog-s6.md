# VDC Rules and Operations Handbook Changelog (Season 6)
*This changelog does not reflect any rulebook changes before version 6.0. For earlier rulebook iterations, please visit
here: (https://github.com/Valorant-Draft-Circuit/VDC-Operations-Rulebook/blob/main/rulebook/changelog-s5.md)*

# Version 6.0

## Added
* **Added "Owner" and "Advisors" under the Glossary of Terms:**
```
- **Owner** - Owner, as a stand-alone role, does not have any voting power, unless in case of a tie-breaker. The Owner possesses the main VDC Discord server, the codebase, staff servers (media, tech, etc.), and all main VDC social media accounts (YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, TikTok, etc.). 

- **Advisors** - Team Leads or former admins who have deep institutional knowledge of the league, assisting Admins in decision-making when requested or necessary. Advisors do not have the powers to directly make decisions for the Admin Team. At Owner's discretion, Advisors may be granted the ability to perform league operations in the event Admins are unable to perform their duties. 
```
*Reason: Two relatively new roles have surfaced as necessary to the operations of the League: Owner and Advisors. While the role of the Owner has been around for awhile, the purpose of it was amorphous beyond merely owning the main VDC Discord server. The league requires ownership of several things, all of which are necessary to its operations, such as the main Discord server, codebase, staff servers (not franchise servers - GMs continue to own those servers), and the main social media accounts.* 

*Advisors were implemented at the end of Season 4 because the Admin team required the help and input of people who have deep institutional knowledge of the League. There have been many questions from the community as a whole as to what Advisors actually do and whether they are necessary. The current Admin team evaluated the merits of keeping the Advisor role and found that Advisors are in these elevated staff roles because they are usually running staff teams that serve as the backbones of the League (ex: Numbers/MMR; Tech; etc.), and therefore require not only a direct line to Admins, but also their input in important discussions about League operations.*

* **Added "Stage O" under the Major Rule Change Process**
```
### Stage 0: Admin Rulebook Review
Prior to beginning the Rule Proposal process, the Admin team may, at their discretion, review the rulebook and make any changes before opening the Rule Proposal process. Any changes made by the Admin team must be recorded in a changelog released to the community at the beginning of the Rule Proposal process.
```
*Reason: This was the unofficial process from Season 5 onwards, and has proven to be a much more streamlined way to update the Rulebook, especially when little changes and updates needed to be made. This process also does not remove the ability for the community to suggest changes to the Rulebook and allows for more visibility on changed, added, or removed rules due to the requirement of a changelog.*

## Changed
* **Changed rule 6.1.6 from:**
```
6.1.6     Any new weapons added to the game are legal at the point of their release.
```
to:
```
6.1.6     When a new weapon is added, it may not be used until the match day 14 days after the patch in which they are introduced. 
    - 6.1.6.1 This rule only applies between the draft and the last regular season game of the season.
    - 6.1.6.2 New weapons added 14 days before playoffs or later may not be used during the postseason.
```
*Reason: Last season, VALORANT added the "Outlaw." Because of the timing of when the weapon was added (right before Mythic and Prospect playoffs), the Admin team at the time needed to decide whether to allow the use of the weapon and risk having the weapon be unbalanced, or disallow the weapon for the remainder of the season. The current Admin team discussed this rule and whether it should remain the same, or if it should be changed. After reflection, any future new weapon added to the game will receive the same treatment as when any new agent is added.*

* **Changed Definition of "Admins" under the Glossary of Terms from:**
```
**Admins** - The league overseers, mostly focusing on long term projects, assisting teams in meeting any goals they need help with, interpreting rules, and making larger league progressionary decisions. The admins have broad authority to make rulings in cases of contention or make changes to the rulebook for the purposes of clarification.

```

```
**Admins** - The league overseers, mostly focusing on long term projects, assisting teams in meeting any goals they need help with, interpreting rules, and making larger league progressionary decisions. The admins have broad authority to make rulings in cases of contention or make changes to the rulebook for the purposes of: clarification; unforeseen circumstances; or for the betterment of the league. 

```
*Reason: Clarifying the duties of Admins and their broad powers helps the League and any future Admins in visualizing their purpose and roles.*
