ALL ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE REPORTED WHEN SIGNING UP FOR VDC.
    - 1.4.2     Players may not play in official VDC matches or combines using any account other than their primary account that was indicated during sign-ups.
    - 1.4.3	When a case of suspected smurfing is reported, the Admin team will investigate. Exact processes will not be disclosed as it may help a player guilty of smurfing protect themselves.

## League Operations

### Section 2. Franchises

- **2.1 Tier Info**
    - 2.1.1	Currently, VDC has 4 tiers: Mythic, Expert, Apprentice, and Prospect from highest to lowest. When the rules mention promotion, this refers to players moving from lower tiers to higher ones. When the rules mention demotion, this refers to players moving from higher tiers to lower tiers.
        - 2.1.1.1 Tiers will not be added or removed in the middle of a season but may be added or removed between seasons.
    - 2.1.2	Each franchise has at most one team per tier. Teams themselves do not move between tiers, but players may move between teams in different tiers.
    - 2.1.3	Rostered players can not move between tiers during a season, unless they are promoted or demoted by their General Manager. Players cannot be demoted to a tier below their base tier.
    - 2.1.4	Every tier has matches scheduled on the same days at the same time, with the exception of some playoff matches or agreed upon rescheduled matches.
        - 2.1.4.1 Matches will be scheduled on Wednesdays and Fridays, but may not be scheduled around major holidays.
        - 2.1.4.2: Admins will create the season schedule with major holidays in mind and will announce prior to the season starting.
- **2.2 General Managers**
    - 2.2.1	General Managers (GMs) are selected by Admins. They each run a single Franchise.
        - 2.2.1.1 GMs are not required to play in the league, but are required to be active within the discord or the league.
        - 2.2.1.2 GMs are selected based on a variety of factors including seasons in the league, AGM experience, punishment history, application answers, and potentially other factors.
    - 2.2.2	GMs may be a rostered player as long as they complete the required number of combines. Any playing GM will be required to use a "Keeper Pick" in the draft. GMs are permitted to cut themselves from their team at any time post draft, if they wish. A GM who does this will not become a Free Agent.
        - 2.2.2.1 A GM who wishes to return to their roster must treat this transaction the same as if they were picking up a Free Agent.
        - 2.2.2.2 A GM can return to their roster in place of a player placed on IR.
        - 2.2.2.3 A GM cannot play as a substitute on any of their teams unless they are actively rostered on another team within their franchise.
- **2.3 Assistant General Managers**
    - 2.3.1	General Managers may appoint Assistant General Managers to help with franchise operations. These players must be approved for the position in a majority vote by Admins. A franchise may have up to 2 AGMs.
    - 2.3.2	Each season, a franchise may replace an existing AGM that occupies an AGM slot once per season. For example, a franchise with 2 AGMs will be permitted to make 2 changes to their active AGMs. The number of available replacements resets whenever a full VDC season ends.
        - 2.3.2.1 If a GM takes over during a season, they are allowed to replace any AGMs one time each, without using their allotted replacements.
        - 2.3.2.2	If a franchise has less than their allotted AGMs, appointing an AGM to reach the limit does not count towards allotted replacements.
        - 2.3.2.3	An AGM stepping down due to leaving the league or leaving a franchise will not count towards the allowed replacements.
    - 2.3.3 If an AGM has been part of the same franchise for at least two consecutive seasons, but was a non-playing AGM in the most recent season and wishes to become a playing AGM in the next season, the GM may offer a renewal contract to the AGM. Any renewal contract offered to an AGM will last for 1 season. The same rules for a player who renewed their contract applies to AGM contract renewals.
        - 2.3.3.1	The AGM must still complete the required number of combines as if they were a new, Draft Eligible player.
        - 2.3.3.2   Any AGM renewed will require a “Keeper Pick” in the draft.
        - 2.3.3.3   AGMs are permitted to cut themselves from their team at any time post draft, if they wish. An AGM who does this will become a Free Agent.
        - 2.3.3.4   An AGM cannot play as a substitute on any of their teams unless they are actively rostered on another team within their franchise.

### Section 3. Team Rosters

- **3.1 Player Contracts**
    - 3.1.1	When a player is drafted or signed from free agency, they enter a 2 season contract. Contracts are to the franchise, not the team, and are tracked by season, not week. Contracts reduce 1 season in duration the day after the final Championship match in a season.
        - 3.1.1.1	If a season is in progress when the player is signed, the season counts as season 1 of 2, regardless of how far into the season the signing occurs.
    - 3.1.2	Players may not choose to leave a team while under contract, but may request to be cut or traded, subject to their GM’s approval.
        - 3.1.2.1	If a player is cut for refusing to play for their team or found to be intentionally sabotaging games, they will be suspended for half of the number of total matches in the season (rounded up) or until the match day following roster lock if the season is more than halfway completed. They will become an RFA after this time.
    - 3.1.3	A player may agree to go on “Inactive Reserve'' (IR) in the event they need to take an extended break. This allows the franchise to indefinitely replace them while keeping the rights to roster them once they return.
        - 3.1.3.1	This break must last a minimum of 4 match days.
        - 3.1.3.2	The MMR of the 6th player replaces the MMR of the player on IR. MMR cap rules still apply.
        - 3.1.3.3	A player on IR is not allowed to play any matches until they are taken off IR.
        - 3.1.3.4  After the final championship match of the season, all players on Inactive Reserve are taken off of Inactive Reserve and moved to the active roster.
- **3.2 Roster Rules**
  - 3.2.1 Teams can not have more than 5 players, with two exceptions.
    - 3.2.1.1 Between the draft and the first pre-season cut day, roster sizes are unlimited.

    - 3.2.1.3 A team may only place one player on IR at a time.
  - 3.2.2	Teams can not have less than 5 players, unless a team had fewer than 5 draft picks. In this case, a Free Agent must be picked up by the roster lock date.
  - 3.2.3	Teams will still be allowed to play in a match should a team suffer a player loss outside of their control in the season, resulting in having 4 active players.
    - 3.2.3.1	The roster should be back up to 5 players by the next match day, whether the missing player is cut or put on IR.
    - 3.2.3.2	The only transactions allowed for such teams are signing Free Agents and promoting from a lower tier.
    - 3.2.3.3	The MMR of the player or players lost is still active against the tier MMR cap until a replacement player or players are found.
    - 3.2.3.4  In the event that a player is removed for smurfing, the guidelines under 1.4.5 will be followed
- **3.3 Team & Tier Movement**
  - 3.3.1	Between seasons, players may move tiers and Franchises may gain or lose teams.
    - 3.3.1.1	If a player is demoted or promoted to a tier where their current franchise does not have a team, and their contract has not expired, the franchise will have until unrestricted transactions are open (or 48 hours, if past that time) to trade the player to another franchise. If the player has been demoted to a lower tier, the franchise will additionally have until the renewal period (or 48 hours, if past that time) to promote the player. If the franchise chooses not to promote or trade the player within this time, they will become a Free Agent.
    - 3.3.1.2	If a franchise loses a team they currently have players in, the franchise will have until unrestricted transactions are open (or 48 hours, if past that time) to trade the player to another franchise.  If the franchise loses a team in a lower tier, the franchise will additionally have until the renewal period (or 48 hours, if past that time) to promote any players from that roster. If the franchise chooses not to promote or trade the player within this time, they will become a Free Agent.
    - 3.3.1.3	If a team moves from one franchise to another due to reassignments, the new franchise will take over all existing contracts.
- **3.4 MMR Caps**
  - 3.4.1	Each team has an MMR cap. Every team in a tier has the same cap.
  - 3.4.2	MMR caps are adjusted at the beginning of every season, prior to the draft.
  - 3.4.3	Each team must remain at or below their cap. Teams are not allowed to exceed their caps at any point, except during the period between the last Championship and the end of preseason.

### Section 4. The Draft

- **4.1	Draft Pick Compensation**
  - 4.1.1	A Franchise may be awarded compensation picks due to loss of players outside of their control in instances such as the following:
  - 4.1.2	If a drafted player is immediately inactive, never joins the franchise discord server, or leaves the league during preseason, the franchise will be awarded a pick for the following season, at the end of the round, 1 round later than the player was selected in the draft.
    - 4.1.2.1	This rule only applies to players originally selected in the first 3 rounds.
  - 4.1.3	If a player goes inactive, outright refuses to play for a roster, or intentionally sabotages games during the season, the franchise will be awarded a pick for the following season, at the end of the round, 2 rounds later than the player was selected in the draft.
    - 4.1.3.1	The awarding of compensatory picks only applies to players originally selected in the first 2 rounds. Any player found to either refuse playing on a roster or intentionally sabotaging games will be punished.
  - 4.1.4	This also applies to players that were signed from free agency or traded for, as long as they have played at least 4 maps for the franchise they are on when going inactive.
    - 4.1.4.1	If a player goes inactive and needs to be removed from the league after being traded, before they play 4 maps for their new franchise, the trade will be reversed and their original franchise will be awarded the compensation pick.
  - 4.1.5	A compensatory pick will not be awarded for a player placed on IR, or players that leave between the last regular season match day and the next draft.
  - 4.1.6	A compensatory draft pick will not be awarded for a cut player. The player must be officially declared inactive and removed from the league by Admins.
  - 4.1.7	If there are multiple compensation picks in a round, their order is determined by the order of the original draft picks for which a team is being granted compensation.
    - 4.1.7.1	Compensation picks that are not granted in relation to a previous draft pick will be placed at the end of the compensation order. If there are multiple of such picks, their order shall be decided randomly, with even weight to all picks.
- **4.2	The VDC Draft**
  - 4.2.1	Every registered VDC player is picked during the draft.
    - 4.2.1.1	The draft is a snake draft where, ignoring trades, the franchise that picks first in a round picks last in the next round.
  - 4.2.2	There is one draft per tier and only one tier of players in each draft.
  - 4.2.3	If a player leaves the league while the draft is ongoing, the pick immediately opens up for the franchise to replace that player with anyone currently un-drafted. This is optional if 2 full rounds worth of picks have passed since the leaving player was drafted.
- **4.3	Keeper Picks**
  - 4.3.1	Franchises who wish to keep a player from a previous season must use a “Keeper Pick”, the round of which is determined by MMR of the player. A keeper pick is a regular draft pick, but is used to keep an already rostered player.
    - 4.3.1.1	If a franchise has more than 1 player requiring a keeper pick in the same round, a better pick must be used to keep the player unless they trade for another pick in that round.
    - 4.3.1.2	Players on IR will need to be drafted with a keeper pick.
  - 4.3.2	The draft will always include a "Keeper Round" at the very end, where up to one player from each team, with a 7th or 8th keeper round, will be guaranteed a draft position. For recordkeeping purposes, the round number will be the last round with a selected or kept player + 1.
    - 4.3.2.1	If a team does not have a player to be kept in the 7th or 8th round, they will not get a pick in the Keeper Round.
    - 4.3.2.2	Picks in the Keeper Round may not be traded.
- **4.4	Draft Lottery**
  - 4.4.1	The draft order is decided by a lottery before offseason transactions open. Each tier has its own lottery. The odds for each team will be calculated as follows:

    - Regular Season Win Percentage * 0.70. Record this as “A”.
  
    - Postseason Placement Score * 0.30. Record this as “B”.
  
    - Postseason Placement Score is 1 for being eliminated round 1, 2 for being eliminated round 2, n-1 for being eliminated in the semifinals, n for being the Runner-Up, and n + 0.5 for being the Champion. This number is then divided by n, which is the number of rounds in finals, to get Postseason Placement Score. For example, if the playoffs involved only semifinals and finals, semifinals would be 1 point, finals would be 2 points, and winner of finals would receive 2.5 points.
  
    - Final Lottery Score is calculated as (2 - A - B)
  
    - All lottery scores in a tier will be added, and each team will have their odds set to (Team Lottery Score / Tier Total Lottery Score)

      - 4.4.1.1	A new franchise will have draft lottery odds set to (Highest Calculated Odds) + (0.02 * (Teams in Tier / 6)) in all tiers. All calculated odds will be scaled to make the total odds equal 100%.
      - 4.4.1.2	A franchise receiving a new team will have draft lottery odds set to (Highest Calculated Odds) + (0.02 * (Teams in Tier / 12)) in all tiers. All calculated odds will be scaled to make the total odds equal 100%.
  - 4.4.2	When a new tier is added, every team will have the same lottery odds.
  - 4.4.3	If a tier adds new teams equal to, or greater than, the total number of teams in the tier the previous season, draft lottery odds will all be equal regardless of previous season results.

### Section 5. Restricted Free Agents

- **5.1	RFA Rules**
  - 5.1.1	Any players that sign up for the league after the draft will enter as a Restricted Free Agent (RFA).
  - 5.1.2	Generally, RFAs are identical to Free Agents. There are 2 key differences.
    - 5.1.2.1	RFAs can not sub for the same franchise 2 match days in a row. For example, RFAs can substitute for a franchise on match days 4 and 6, but not match days 4 and 5.
    - 5.1.2.2	RFAs can not permanently sign with a franchise.
  - 5.1.3	RFAs have the option to return to the league the next season as a Draft Eligible. If the player wants to remain an RFA due to availability, they should fill out the Intent form as not returning and sign up for RFA when the form goes out.
  - 5.1.4	RFAs may be moved to regular Free Agency if a tier is in need of Free Agents.
    - 5.1.4.1	Admins, by majority vote, may choose to move RFAs to FA status when they deem it to be necessary. Some examples may include: Low number of FAs, only 0.75 free agents per team in a tier, or poor mix of MMRs of FAs.
    - 5.1.4.2	RFAs will be promoted based on the date and time in which the RFAs signed up for the league, with those that signed up earliest being asked to move first.
      - 5.1.4.2.1	If a player was drafted to a team prior to their schedule changing, leaving the league, and returned to RFA, they will not be eligible for return to Free Agency until every new RFA has been asked to move.
    - 5.1.4.3	RFAs will be moved until all available and willing RFAs have been moved or it is determined that enough free agents exist for all teams within a tier.
    - 5.1.4.4	In order to be moved, RFAs need to have signed up as an RFA prior to the match day the tier was confirmed to have too few Free Agents per team.
    - 5.1.4.5	RFAs moved to Free Agency will enter on waivers.
    - 5.1.4.6	Once the season is more than 75% completed, RFAs will no longer be moved to Free Agency, regardless of the number of available Free Agents.
  - 5.1.5	Any player who is cut for their schedule conflicting with the league will be moved to RFA.

    - 6.1.7.1	The Media Team is exempt from this rule for official VDC streams.
- **6.2	Lobby Setup**
  - 6.2.1	VDC uses Valorant custom game servers for matches.
    - 6.2.1.1 Matches should be played on the server with the lowest ping difference between the highest and lowest ping player in a lobby. This is calculated by subtracting the highest player’s ping with the lowest player’s ping.

    - 6.2.1.3 	If teams are unable to calculate the ping difference between each server, the match will be played on the Illinois server.
  - 6.2.2	The captain of the home team should create the lobby, friend the opposing captain, and ensure all players on both teams join.
  - 6.2.3	Game settings should be as follows:
    - 6.2.3.1	Allow Cheats: Off
    - 6.2.3.2	Tournament Mode: On
    - 6.2.3.3	Overtime Win By 2: On
    - 6.2.3.4	Play Out All Rounds: Off

    - 6.2.4.2	The order for map vetoes is: Away Ban, Home Ban, Away Ban, Home Ban, Home Pick, Away Pick. The final map is ignored.
    - 6.2.4.3	Teams choose whether they start Attacking or Defending on their opponents map pick.

    - 6.2.6.1	If it is clear that a cheat being used was accidental (ex. A player accidentally hitting their Ghost keybind but immediately disabling it with no further incident), no punishment will be incurred and the match can play on as normal.
    - 6.2.6.2	A round rollback may be executed in some cases if the cheat is misused during a round in a streamed match.
  - 6.2.7	Following each map, a 5 minute break will ensue, unless both teams agree to start earlier.
    - 6.2.7.1	If all 5 players are not ready after 5 minutes, a DM should be sent to their captain. After another 5 minutes, the map will be forfeited.
  - 6.2.8	The home team captain is obligated to have the lobby created and set up within 5 minutes of the match start time. The away team captain is obligated to have their team joining the lobby no later than the scheduled match start time. If either obligation is breached, the captain of the team not following their duties should be alerted by a DM 5 minutes after the scheduled match start time.
    - 6.2.8.1	10 minutes after the DM is sent, if no valid and verifiable reason is given for the delay, map 1 will be forfeited.
    - 6.2.8.2	15 minutes after the DM is sent, if no valid and verifiable reason is given for the delay, map 2 will be forfeited.
- **6.3	Playoff Lobby Setup**
  - 6.3.1	Game settings, lobby setup, and delay rules are identical to the regular season.
  - 6.3.2	During playoffs, the better seeded team will choose whether they veto first or second. The order is as follows: veto-veto, pick-pick, veto-veto, with one map remaining. One team selects their starting side on their opponent’s map pick.
    - 6.3.2.1	In map 3, the better seeded team chooses their starting side.
  - 6.3.3	For Playoff matches, players may request a break period of up to 10 minutes, but will otherwise be given a maximum of 5 minutes.
    - 6.3.3.1	If all 5 players on a team are not ready after 5 minutes (or 10 minutes if that break was agreed upon), the other team should be sent a 5 minute warning. If all players are not ready 5 minutes after the other team is alerted, the map will be forfeited.
- **6.4	Bugs and Exploits**
  - 6.4.1	Intentional use of any bugs, glitches, exploits, or any other unintended actions is not allowed. Upon receiving a report that a bug was used, Admins will review any available evidence and make a ruling. Admins may award map wins, match wins, and/or levy punishments on the players who break this rule if it is determined that use of the bug impacted the outcome of a map or match.
  - 6.4.2	Examples of actions that are not allowed include, but are not limited to, the following:
    - Moving on, under, or through any areas that are not intended by the map design (any walls, ceilings, floors, etc).
    - Using an exploit or glitch to plant or place the spike in an area that gives an unfair advantage. However, it is okay to use Sage walls to block the bomb or secure it in a certain area (such as in the cubby on Icebox B site).
    - Boosting on top of teammates is not allowed when it allows players to see through solid objects or remove textures to gain an unfair advantage. Boosting on top of a teammate is otherwise allowed.
    - Pixel walking. A player will be considered to be pixel walking if they sit or stand on invisible pixels on the map, such as using Jett updrafts to land on a high up invisible ledge
    - All Cypher cam placements that afford an unfair competitive advantage via abusing map textures and/or geometry to prevent the Cypher cam from being destroyed or seen are considered banned exploits. All Cypher cam placements must result in a Cypher cam that is destructible, that is viewable by both teams, and that does not exploit map textures and/or geometry to create a one-way view that provides an unfair advantage. Any other uses of a Cypher cam that are determined by the VDC admin team to provide an unfair competitive advantage will also be considered banned exploits.
    - All uses of agent utility that afford an unfair competitive advantage via abusing map textures and/or geometry to prevent the agent utility from being destroyed or seen are considered banned exploits. Agent utility cannot be used in areas that are outside of map boundaries while potentially providing any useful information or advantage at any point. Areas that are within map boundaries are defined as areas where all utility is (1) destructible as intended for that utility, (2) has the ability to be seen by both teams as intended for that utility, and (3) does not exploit map texture and/or geometry to provide an unfair competitive advantage.
    - A player shall not alter the utility’s intended purpose and scope of usage by abusing map textures and/or geometry, abusing unintended interactions with other utility, unintended interactions with weapons, or other types of unintended interactions to gain an unfair competitive advantage. Any other uses of an agent's utility that are determined by the VDC admin team to provide an unfair competitive advantage will also be considered banned exploits.
    - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS: KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability is intended to be usable outside of map boundaries, and is a special exception regarding these rules. KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability is allowed to be placed outside of map boundaries, and at other locations that cause KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability to be indestructible and/or unviewable by the enemy players. However, the knife model of KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability cannot abuse or exploit map textures and/or geometry to travel to unintended locations. For example, the knife model of KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability may not travel through or inside map textures and/or geometry that are intended to be solid. Teams should clear specific trajectories or end locations for KAYO's ZERO/POINT ability with VDC Admins prior to usage if the Team is unsure whether that usage complies with this special exception rule.
    - 6.4.2.1	When a bug exploit has been reported, it will be handled as follows:
      - Review the clip(s) presented to us and make an initial ruling.
      - Inform the reporting team of the initial ruling.
      - If the initial ruling is that an exploit was used, ask the offending team to present anything that would contradict the use of an exploit.
      - Make a final conclusion based on all evidence presented.
  - 6.4.3	Breakable utility is any agent ability that can be destroyed, either by being shot or by using other utility. Breakable utility does not include any smokes (including Harbor’s) or flashes. Breakable utility may not be intentionally placed:
    - Out of bounds, with the exceptions of Sova dart, Fade eye, and Cypher camera as long as they can be easily destroyed while retaining their full functionality, and KAY/O knife whether or not it can be destroyed.
    - In a spot that makes the utility unbreakable without the use of certain abilities.
    - Wedged between a box, crate, or other similar object, and an indestructible part of the map. Teams should first give their opponents a warning in chat if they wedge utility between a box and the map, and report with evidence in a ticket if the placement continues to be used.
  - 6.4.4	It is recommended to check with Admins to find out whether or not a certain bug, glitch, or placement of utility is considered legal. Admins reserve the right to make changes, even retroactively, to this list, and rule use of bugs on a case by case basis.
  - **6.5	Pauses and Disconnects**
  - 6.5.1	If a player disconnects mid-game, they are allowed to join back as soon as possible. If players are unable to reconnect to the game, contact an admin and the match will be restored to the best of our ability.
  - 6.5.2	Teams are allowed to pause when one of their players disconnects or has a technical issue. This should be done with 0:05 or more remaining on the timer during the Buy Phase, by using the Pause Match Timer option in the Cheats menu made available by Tournament Mode. If a pause is called with under 0:05 remaining, a warning should be given. For any additional offense on the same match night, the offending team will forfeit the current map.
    - 6.5.2.1	Teams are allowed to pause for technical issues. All pauses may, but are not required to, last up to a total of 20 minutes per match day.
    - 6.5.2.2	If the combined total of technical pauses reaches 15 minutes during a match day, the pausing team should be given a 5 minute warning. If the combined total reaches 19 minutes, the pausing team should be given a 1 minute warning. Any further delay of technical pauses past the 20 minute mark may result in a forfeit for the pausing team.
  - 6.5.3	Rounds in which a player disconnects but a tech pause is not called will not be rolled back for any reason. If a disconnect occurs in a round where the game is won by either team, the match result stands.
- **6.6	Game Results**
  - 6.6.1	Players should submit their match via the /submit command in the VDC Discord Bot. 

## Transactions

### Section 7. General Guidelines

  - 7.1.2	The season trade deadline is 30 minutes before the first match day after the season reaches 67% complete.
  - 7.1.3	The match day transaction deadline is 15 minutes before the scheduled match time.
    - 7.1.3.1	Transactions posted less than 15 minutes before a match is scheduled to begin will be invalid if a substitute, and processed to take effect the next match day if a signing, cut, trade, or IR.
  - 7.2	Poaching
    - 7.2.1	Poaching is defined as any discussion occurring between an agent of a Franchise ("Party A") and a contracted player on a different franchise, ("Party B"), regarding transactions that might acquire or otherwise move Party B to Party A.
      - 7.2.1.1	Party A may contact Party B expressing interest in acquiring them, if their contract is expired, within a specified time range in the offseason known as the Open Discussion period.
      - 7.2.1.2	If Party A contacts a player whose contract is not expired at any time the action may result in a punishment including, but not limited to, indefinite removal from their position. Everything regarding poaching is handled on a case by case basis.
    - 7.2.2	Any transaction stemming from poaching activity will be voided or reversed.
    - 7.2.3	If a player who is approached by a team official thinks it may be an act of poaching, they should report it via a ticket or to an Admin. Reports will be handled anonymously and will give immunity within reason from punishment and retaliation to the player reporting it. If someone has knowledge of an act of poaching, but does not report it, they may be subject to punishment.

### Section 8. Waivers
- **8.1	Waivers, Explained**
  - 8.1.1	VDC utilizes waivers to allow some teams to have a claim on players before others. Contracted players who are cut will go through a waiver period where they can be picked up by another team.
  - 8.1.2	Players cut in the offseason or preseason will not go on waivers. Anyone cut after the roster lock deadline, as stated in Rule 11.2.1.2, will go on waivers.
  - 8.1.3	Players can only be claimed from waivers to play for a team in the tier their waiver belongs to.
  - 8.1.4	Players signed from waivers will retain the contract they had with their old franchise, and will not be given a fresh 2 season contract.
  - 8.1.5	Players may not decline being signed during the waiver period in order to sign with another franchise.
  - 8.1.6	Players who are not picked up on waivers will become uncontracted Free Agents.
- **8.2	The Waiver Order**
  - 8.2.1	The waiver order is determined by the inverse of team standings within a tier, with the worst team in a tier getting the first waiver claim and the best team in a tier getting the last waiver claim.
    - 8.2.1.1	Teams who have a player leave VDC after the preseason will be awarded the best waiver position for 7 days or until they pick up a player, even if not via waiver claim. If more than one team has a player that leaves, teams who lost more players get the better spot, followed by teams whose player(s) left first.
    - 8.2.1.2	When a team makes a waiver claim, they will move to last in the waiver order for their tier until the next waiver update.
  - 8.2.2	The waiver order is updated each time new RFAs are moved to Free Agency. If no RFAs have been moved in 4 match days, the waiver order will be updated. The waiver order may not be updated more than once in a 2 match day period.
  - 8.2.3	The waiver order prior to Match Day 3 will be the inverse of the draft order in each individual tier. This order ignores any trading of picks that occurred.
- **8.3	Waiver Periods**
  - 8.3.1	Waiver periods for players end every Noon EST the day before each match day.
    - 8.3.1.1	If a player is placed on waivers, their waiver period will end after one week.

### Section 9. Trading

- 9.1	Trading Regulations
  - 9.1.1	Trades should be executed in good faith. This means trades should show an obvious benefit to both parties. Any abuse of the trading system may result in trading sanctions on the franchise, imposed by Admins or Transaction Managers.
  - 9.1.2	If there is reasonable doubt that a General Manager will not return in the following season, or is trading away an excessive amount of future draft picks, Admins may vote to remove rights to trading from a franchise.
    - 9.1.2.1	All Admins that are not on the franchise must vote.
    - 9.1.2.2	The franchise may not trade while the vote is ongoing.
    - 9.1.2.3	In the event there is no majority in the vote, the franchise will retain their rights to trade.
  - 9.1.3	Admins and Transaction Managers have the right to deny any trades. Generally, this right will only be exercised in situations where trades are very one sided or a franchise is being taken advantage of. This requires discussion between Admins and Transactions, and will not involve anyone with a strong conflict of interests.
  - 9.1.4	Before the draft for a season, transactions will be temporarily opened to allow franchises to re-sign players, freely make roster changes, and trade with other franchises. This offseason transaction period will open after numbers lock and close at the pre draft roster lock date (See 11.2).
    - 9.1.4.1	During the draft, franchises may trade draft picks and players that have yet to be drafted with a keeper pick. Franchises may not trade players that were drafted in that season's draft, including players kept from the previous season.

    - 9.2.1.1	Example: During season 2, only draft picks for the season 3 draft can be traded. During the offseason transaction period prior to the season 3 draft, draft picks for the season 3 and 4 drafts can be traded.


- *The following draft pick trade rules are in place to protect new GMs from being left with too few picks, prevent franchises from stacking one team at the expense of another, and minimize abuse in trading.*

  - 9.2.2	When trading draft picks for the upcoming draft during the offseason transaction period:
    - 9.2.2.1	All teams must retain one 1st or 2nd round draft pick, or have 3 picks between the 3rd and 4th rounds.
    - 9.2.2.2	All teams must retain at least 3 picks between round 1 and the last complete round. The last complete round will be recorded as of 48 hours prior to the closing of offseason transactions.
  - 9.2.3	When trading draft picks for the next season during the offseason transaction period or during the regular season:
    - 9.2.3.1	Only 1st through 5th round picks may be traded, as picks in the 6th round and beyond are not guaranteed.
    - 9.2.3.2	All teams must retain one 1st or 2nd round draft pick, or have 2 picks in the 3rd round.
    - 9.2.3.3	All teams must retain at least two picks between the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds unless they have two picks in the first 2 rounds.
    - 9.2.3.4	All teams must retain at least 3 draft picks between rounds 1 and 5.
    - 9.2.3.5  A franchise may not have a pick count in a tier that exceeds 2 more than the latest round in the draft. For example, if one tier has 7 rounds in the draft, a franchise cannot have more than 9 picks in the draft.

### Section 15. Offseason Transactions

- **15.1	General Guidelines**

  - 15.1.2	Franchises are free to talk to players they have on contract at any time.
  - 15.1.3	Franchises may not contact a player who would be mid-contract, but is not returning, until they are retired or their current franchise gives permission (whichever happens first). If their contract would have expired, they may be first contacted during Open Discussion or when their current franchise gives permission (whichever happens first).
  - 15.1.4	A retiring player looking to take an AGM position with another franchise can be moved prior to being retired if their current franchise agrees. If they were mid-contract, and later choose to play in the upcoming season, their new franchise will be forced to trade to retain them.
- **15.2	Stage 1: Open Discussions**
  - 15.2.1	Franchises will be allowed to contact any player whose contract is expiring, to express interest in them, should they choose not to renew their contract with their current franchise.
  - 15.2.2	Poaching rules outlined in Section 7.2 do not apply during this period. Franchises may only contact players to inform them that they are interested in offering them a contract.
    - 15.2.2.1 Discussions should not go further than an inquiry, any other discussion should be done through the franchise that currently has the player on contract. If the current franchise gives permission to continue discussions to both the player and inquiring GM, it will be allowed.
    - 15.2.2.2 If discussions go further, including but not limited to offering an AGM position, the management of the inquiring franchise may be barred from signing the player and/or face further punishment.
- **15.3	Stage 2: Cuts/Renewals**
  - 15.3.1	Poaching rules in Section 7.2 apply. Franchises may no longer talk to players directly.
  - 15.3.2	Following Open Discussion, franchises will be able to renew contracts with players. Any expiring contracts will need to be renewed or the player will become a Free Agent that may be signed by any other franchise during Unrestricted Transactions. Any renewed contracts will last for 1 season. The number of contract renewals a player may make is not limited.
    - 15.3.2.1 Players who do not renew their contract during any of the previous periods may re-sign to the franchise on a one season contract.
  - 15.3.3	Any players may be cut, including those with seasons remaining on their contracts.
  - 15.3.4	Contract renewals are treated as new signings for the purpose of rule enforcement.
  - 15.3.5	At the end of this Stage, all players whose contracts were not renewed will be ended and the players will become Free Agents that will be drafted if not signed. Any players renewed will require a "Keeper Pick" in the draft.

## In Season Processes

### Section 16. Tiebreakers

- **16.1	Tiebreakers**
  - 16.1.1	If two or more teams have the same regular season record, ties between the teams will be resolved using the following tiebreakers, in order:
    - 16.1.1.1	Head to Head Record
    - 16.1.1.2	Head to Head Round Differential
    - 16.1.1.3	Overall Round Win Percentage
    - 16.1.1.4	(Optional) BO1 Series
    - 16.1.1.5	Coin Flip
  - 16.1.2	If there is a tie between 3 or more teams, tiebreakers will be resolved by going down the list and removing teams with a defined advantage or disadvantage in a category.
    - 16.1.2.1	Head to Head is broken by combining all wins and losses, regardless of who they are against. For example, Team A, Team B, Team C, and Team D are in a 4 way tie. Between them, Team A is 5-1, Teams B and C are 3-3, and Team D is 1-5. Team A takes first in the tiebreaker and Team D takes 4th. Teams B and C tied their H2H matchup 1-1. Teams B and C advance to the next tiebreaker.
    - 16.1.2.2	Head to Head Round Differential is now the tiebreaker. Team B beat Team C on Bind 12-6. Team C beat Team B on Split 12-10. Team B has the better round differential (+6 > +2), so they win the tiebreaker.
    - 16.1.2.3	Say Team C had also won 12-6. Now they move to Overall Round Win Percentage. This factors back in every match the teams have played this season (Season Rounds Won / Season Rounds Played). Whoever is higher takes 2nd!

### Section 17. Playoffs

## Major Rule Change Process

### Stage 0: Admin Rulebook Review
Prior to beginning the Rule Proposal process, the Admin team may, at their discretion, review the rulebook and make any changes before opening the Rule Proposal process. Any changes made by the Admin team must be recorded in a changelog released to the community at the beginning of the Rule Proposal process. 

### Stage 1: The Community
At the end of the season, a discord channel will be opened for players to:

- Mention which rules caused problems

- Highlight rules that impacted how smoothly the league operated

- Suggest rules that did not exist, that players think should exist

- Suggest changes or additions to existing rules


### Stage 2: Administration
Admins take the community suggestions and polish them to fit the style of the rulebook, assign rule numbers for if the rule is accepted, and assign a Proposal number to the suggested change. They may also add their own proposals. Admins may veto community rules if they, despite popular support, go against the ideals of the league.

### Stage 3: Proposal Voting
Any players that participated in the last season will be eligible to vote on all proposals in a form sent out in the Announcement channel. At the same time, Admins and Team Leads will vote separately.

### Stage 4: Results

Votes will be counted at the conclusion of voting. A 2/3 majority is required for a proposal to pass. A vote that ends with exactly 2/3 in favor will pass. Leadership and Admins reserve the right to veto passed proposals if they are not in the best interests of the league or go against the vision in mind for VDC. A rule with over 80% in favor may not be vetoed. A veto requires at least a majority +1 Leaders/Admins to vote in favor of the veto.
