# VDC Rules and Operations Handbook Changelog (Season 5)
*This changelog does not reflect any rulebook changes before version 5.0. For earlier rulebook iterations, please visit 
here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16-gcSJ6cnG8Pr4rCEG5-NWjY5KbmCE5egyvhXpoJD5k*

# Version 5.1
*10/20/2023 - Clarified Rule 15.2.2.2*

## Changed
* **Changed rule 15.2.2.2 from:**
```
15.2.2.2    If discussions go further, the management of the inquiring franchise may be barred from signing the player 
            and/or face further punishment.
```
to:
```
15.2.2.2    If discussions go further, including but not limited to offering an AGM position, the management of the 
            inquiring franchise may be barred from signing the player and/or face further punishment.
```
*Reason: The previous rule was unclear and caused newer GMs to misinterpret what was allowed and disallowed during Open Discussion.*


# Version 5.0 
*9/17/2023 - Season 5 Rulebook Rewrite*

## Added
* **Added rules 1.2.2.3 and 1.2.2.4:**
```
1.2.2.3 Observers and other players who occupy the observer slot cannot delay the game or call a technical pause for 
        any reason, including issues with the stream, unless all players unanimously agree to take a pause. Media may 
        ask players in chat to pause for stream issues, but they cannot proceed unless both teams give permission.
1.2.2.4 If a technical pause is taken, any team may unpause and resume play at any time.
```
*Reason: As much as having a stable VDC stream is important, it should not impact any match in any meaningful way,
especially if it is against the wishes of the players in the match. This gives players the option to pause the match,
rather than having it forced on them in the middle of play, possibly affecting the outcome of the match.*

* **Added rule 1.4.2 (shifted previous rule 1.4.2, previously 1.5.2, and all rules following down 1 number):**
```
1.4.2 Players may not play in official VDC matches or combines using any account other than their primary account 
      that was indicated during sign-ups.
```
*Reason: Not only does this add another layer of protection against stuff like account sharing or HWID evasion during
matches, but the way stats will be taken from Season 5 onwards requires that matches be played on a player's primary
account.*

* **Added rules 1.4.5, 1.4.5.1, 1.4.5.2 :**
```
1.4.5   If a player is found to be smurfing and their MMR is adjusted to a point where they can no longer play on their 
        original team, the smurfing player’s former team will have 1 week or 2 match days, whichever is longer, to sign 
        a replacement player.
1.4.5.1 Until then, the team will be allowed to use a substitute player in place of this player during matches.
1.4.5.2 Any substitutes who sub for the smurfing player do not count towards the 2 substitute maximum.
```
*Reason: This rule allows teams ample time to find a replacement player for those who were removed because of smurfing.*

* **Added rule 1.4.6:**
```
1.4.6 Boosting or being boosted via the use of account sharing qualifies as smurfing, as it breaks the Terms of 
      Service by Riot.
```
*Reason: This rule ensures VDC abides by Riot TOS.*

* **Added rule 3.1.3.4:**
```
3.1.3.4  After the final championship match of the season, all players on Inactive Reserve are taken off of Inactive 
         Reserve and moved to the active roster.
```
*Reason: Admins didn't see a reason to keep players on Inactive Reserve during the offseason, and it makes it easier 
for new GMs to keep track of their players.*

* **Added rule 2.3.2.4:**
```
3.2.3.4  In the event that a player is removed for smurfing, the guidelines under 1.4.5 will be followed.
```
*Reason: Keeps current rule set involving punishments consistent with added rules and sub-rules of 1.4.5.*

* **Added rule 6.1.4.2:**
```
6.1.4.2  New agents added 14 days before playoffs or later may not be used during the postseason.
```
*Reason: This rule protects the competitive integrity of the postseason. A new and/or potentially game-breaking agent 
that is added on such a short notice before playoffs could disrupt any preparation the teams had made coming into 
playoffs by making them obsolete. Therefore, if playoffs begin before the 14 day period for the agent to be usable 
expires, that agent may not be used at all during the postseason.*

* **Added rules 6.2.1.2 and 6.2.1.3:**
```
6.2.1.2 	Players with >100 or <30 ping on multiple servers should not be taken into account.
6.2.1.3 	If teams are unable to calculate the ping difference between each server, the match will be played on the 
            Illinois server. 
```
*Reason: These rules were added in addition to changing 6.2.1.1 (see that change) to ensure that extreme outliers whose 
ping would not change because of the new rule would not affect server placement. In addition, 6.2.1.3 ensures that 
matches could still be played if players are not able to find an acceptable server to play on.*

* **Added rule 9.2.3.5:**
```
9.2.3.5 A franchise may not have a pick count in a tier that exceeds 2 more than the latest round in the draft. For 
        example, if one tier has 7 rounds in the draft, a franchise cannot have more than 9 picks in the draft. This is 
        subject to change on a per season basis, and if it is changed an announcement will be made.
```
*Reason: Throughout VDC, there have been franchises who have drafted an extreme number of players and had to cut down 
to 5 during that season. The players who were cut often left VDC, leaving the tier without adequate FAs and overall 
reducing engagement within the league. This rule aims to keep those players within the league while not detracting too 
much from the trade capital that GMs are allowed to possess.*

* **Added rule 14.1.1.4:**
```
14.1.1.4  Any attempt to mislead teams or otherwise cause forfeits through confusion regarding reschedules will result 
          in punishment. Possible punishments include a forfeit, removal from GM/AGM position, or match day bans.
```
*Reason: This rule will prevent any situations where teams will try to scam a forfeit win out of another team. 
Additionally, this has happened before and caused a great deal of problems for both teams, so this rule aims to prevent 
this scenario from ever happening again.*

* **Added rule 17.1.3.1 (old 17.1.3.1 is now 17.1.3.2):**
```
17.1.3.1  Teams may agree upon a Best of 3 instead, but the default for championships will be a Best of 5. Any change 
          to the championship series must be reported in both teams’ transaction channels.
```
*Reason: If teams can't commit to a full BO5 series or otherwise don't want to spend that much time in a championship 
match, the option of a normal BO3 should be available.*

* **Added rule 17.2.4:**
```
17.2.4  With a tier of an odd number of teams or more than 16 teams, admins will decide on a playoff format for the 
        season.
```
*Reason: Ideally, a new tier would be added instead of more than 16 teams, but in the event that this happens or a tier 
is left with an odd number of teams again, a rule exists for it.*

## Changed
* **Changed rule 1.1.1.1 (previously 1.2.1.1) from:**
```
1.2.1.1 Leaving the Discord can lead to a one or more season ban from VDC, ruled on a case by case basis depending 
	on various factors such as time into the season, duration of departure, league tenure, past punishment record, 
	and more.
```
to:
```
1.1.1.1 Leaving the Discord while signed to a roster can lead to a one or more season ban from VDC, ruled on a case 
        case basis depending on various factors such as time into the season, duration of departure, league tenure, 
        past punishment record, and more.
```
*Reason: Leaving the discord mid-season is potentially punishable, while leaving during the offseason is not. The 
rulebook needed to reflect that change.*

* **Changed rules 1.1.3 and 1.1.3.1 (previously 1.2.3 and 1.2.3.1) from:**
```
1.2.3   10 competitive matches played in the current Act are required.
1.2.3.1	If an Act ends and a new one begins while signups are open, 10 competitive matches in the prior act will be 
	accepted.
```
to:
```
1.1.3   Any combination of 10 competitive or premier matches played in the current Act are required.
1.1.3.1	If an Act ends and a new one begins while signups are open, any combination of 10 competitive or premier matches
        in the prior act will be accepted.
```
*Reason: The Stats Team is now able to pull Premier matches from a user's data.*

* **Changed rule 1.2.1, 1.2.1.1, 1.2.1.2 (previously 1.3.1, 1.3.1.1, 1.3.1.2) from:**
```
1.3.1 	Players may stream, record, and upload VDC gameplay as they wish.
1.3.1.1	To protect the integrity of matches, we ask that any streams have at least a 2 minute delay enabled.
1.3.1.2	Please keep streams relatively family friendly. You are essentially representing the league in any content while
        playing in VDC. This includes informing teammates that you are streaming/recording.
1.3.1.3	By signing up to VDC, you agree we may stream, record, and upload any and all matches you play in the league.
```
to:
```
1.2.1 	Players may stream, record, and upload VDC gameplay as they wish, provided their stream settings meet the 
        following requirements:
1.2.1.1	To protect the integrity of matches, all streams must have at least a 90 second delay enabled.
1.2.1.2	Your stream must follow all VDC behavior guidelines, Riot Terms of Service, and the Terms of Service of the 
        chosen streaming platforms.
```
*Reason: Enforcing a minimum 90 second stream delay prevents stream sniping in a match. Additionally, streams must 
follow all applicable TOS or rule sets to protect VDC and its users from evil lawyer people.*

* **Changed 2.1.1 from:**
```
2.1.1	Currently, VDC has 4 tiers: Premier, Master, Advanced, and Contender from highest to lowest. When the rules 
        mention promotion, this refers to players moving from lower tiers to higher ones. When the rules mention demotion, this 
        refers to players moving from higher tiers to lower tiers.
```
to:
```
2.1.1	Currently, VDC has 4 tiers: Mythic, Expert, Apprentice, and Prospect from highest to lowest. When the rules 
        mention promotion, this refers to players moving from lower tiers to higher ones. When the rules mention demotion, this 
        refers to players moving from higher tiers to lower tiers.
```
*Reason: These are the new tier names that were decided upon, since 3/4 of the previous tier names were used in 
VALORANT's Premier game mode.*

* **Changed rule 2.2.2.3 from:**
```
2.2.2.3	A GM can not return to their roster temporarily as a substitute.
```
to:
```
2.2.2.3 A GM cannot play as a substitute on any of their teams unless they are actively rostered on another team within 
        their franchise.
```
*Reason: This rule change merges 2.2.2.3 and the former rule 2.2.3.4 and also clarifies that GMs can sub up a tier if 
they are playing on a team in a lower tier.*

* **Changed rules 3.1.2.1, 4.1.3, and 4.1.3.1 from:**
```
3.1.2.1	If a player is cut for refusing to play for their team, they will be suspended for half of the number of total 
        matches in the season (rounded up) or until the match day following roster lock if the season is more than 
        halfway completed. They will become an RFA after this time.
4.1.3	If a player goes inactive or refuses to play for a roster during the season, the franchise will be awarded a 
        pick for the following season, at the end of the round, 2 rounds later than the player was selected in the 
        draft.
4.1.3.1	This rule only applies to players originally selected in the first 2 rounds.
```
to:
```
3.1.2.1	If a player is cut for refusing to play for their team or found to be intentionally sabotaging games, they will 
        be suspended for half of the number of total matches in the season (rounded up) or until the match day 
        following roster lock if the season is more than halfway completed. They will become an RFA after this time.
4.1.3	If a player goes inactive, outright refuses to play for a roster, or intentionally sabotages games during the 
        season, the franchise will be awarded a pick for the following season, at the end of the round, 2 rounds later 
        than the player was selected in the draft.
4.1.3.1	The awarding of compensatory picks only applies to players originally selected in the first 2 rounds. Any 
        player found to either refuse playing on a roster or intentionally sabotaging games will be punished.
```
*Reason: The rulebook needed to outline a process for dealing with players who intentionally throw while on a roster, 
so we decided to treat them the same way as someone refusing to play.*

* **Changed rules 3.3.1.1 and 3.3.1.2 from:**
```
3.3.1.1	If a player is demoted to a tier where their current franchise does not have a team, the franchise will have 48 
        hours to promote the player. If the player was promoted to a tier where their current franchise does not have a 
        team, or the franchise elects not to promote a demoted player, the player will become a Free Agent.
3.3.1.2	If a franchise loses a team in a tier they currently have players in, they will become Free Agents.
```
to:
```
3.3.1.1	If a player is demoted or promoted to a tier where their current franchise does not have a team, and their 
        contract has not expired, the franchise will have until unrestricted transactions are open (or 48 hours, if 
        past that time) to trade the player to another franchise. If the player has been demoted to a lower tier, the 
        franchise will additionally have until the renewal period (or 48 hours, if past that time) to promote the 
        player. If the franchise chooses not to promote or trade the player within this time, they will become a Free 
        Agent.
3.3.1.2	If a franchise loses a team they currently have players in, the franchise will have until unrestricted 
        transactions are open (or 48 hours, if past that time) to trade the player to another franchise.  If the 
        franchise loses a team in a lower tier, the franchise will additionally have until the renewal period (or 48 
        hours, if past that time) to promote any players from that roster. If the franchise chooses not to promote or 
        trade the player within this time, they will become a Free Agent.
```
*Reason: GMs should have the option to receive compensation for losing teams due to a lack of players. These rules give 
GMs the opportunity to trade away players for capital in other tiers as a consequence of them losing teams to Free 
Agency. Please note that rule 3.3.1.3 remains unchanged, so GMs who lose their team to another franchise will not be 
able to trade capital for those players.*

* **Changed rules 5.1.4.1 and 5.1.4.3 from:**
```
5.1.4.1	During a season, if a tier drops below 0.75 Free Agents per team, Admins may choose to move RFAs. This is not a 
        set number, and Admins are free to move players to Free Agency if they feel the move is best for the health 
        of the tier.
5.1.4.3	RFAs will be moved until all available RFAs have been moved/requested to remain RFA, or the number of Free 
        Agents per team is greater than 1.5.
```
to:
```
5.1.4.1	Admins, by majority vote, may choose to move RFAs to FA status when they deem it to be necessary. Some examples 
        may include: Low number of FAs, only 0.75 free agents per team in a tier, or poor mix of MMRs of FAs.
5.1.4.3	RFAs will be moved until all available and willing RFAs have been moved or it is determined that enough free 
        agents exist for all teams within a tier.
```
*Reason: Made it clear that limits of 0.75 to 1.5 free agents per tier are suggestions, not absolute limits for admins 
to follow. This will hopefully allow us to move RFAs to free agency more often if a tier needs it.*

* **Changed rules 6.1.2, 6.1.2.1 from:**
```
6.1.2	League matches will be played on the official competitive map pool set by Riot and will be specifically defined 
        as the current map pool used in competitive play on the day of the draft before each season. The map pool will 
        remain consistent throughout each season and will only be updated between seasons unless a map becomes 
        unavailable. The map pool is currently:	
6.1.2.1	Ascent	
6.1.2.2	Fracture	
6.1.2.3	Haven	
6.1.2.4	Bind	
6.1.2.5	Lotus	
6.1.2.6	Pearl	
6.1.2.7	Split
```
to:
```
6.1.2	League matches will be played on the official competitive map pool set by Riot and will be specifically defined 
        as the current map pool used in competitive play on the day of the draft before each season. The map pool will 
        remain consistent starting at the end of preseason and the final championship of the season unless a map 
        becomes unavailable. The map pool is currently:
6.1.2.1	Ascent
6.1.2.2	Bind
6.1.2.3	Breeze
6.1.2.4	Haven
6.1.2.5	Lotus
6.1.2.6	Split
6.1.2.7	Sunset
```
*Reason: Updated the map pool for Season 5 and also added further clarification for when the map pool is allowed to be 
updated. Unless older maps are removed from the custom map selection, the same maps will be used throughout a VDC season 
to retain competitive integrity.* 

* **Changed rule 6.1.3 from:**
```
6.1.3	If Riot makes a map unavailable, Admins will work towards a resolution.
```
to:
```
6.1.3	If Riot makes a map unavailable in the custom lobby, the standard procedure is to proceed without that map in 
        the active pool. Admins may find a replacement map to add to the pool or change the standard procedure at any given 
        time.
```
*Reason: Added a standard procedure for the instance of a map being removed from competitive play. If another procedure 
exists that is easier to follow for a specific instance of this rule, text is also there to allow future admins to 
do so.*

* **Changed rule 6.1.4.1 from:**
```
6.1.4.1	This rule only applies between the draft and the last Championship game of the season.
```
to:
```
6.1.4.1	This rule only applies between the draft and the last regular season game of the season.
```
*Reason: To protect the competitive integrity of the postseason, newly-added agents will not be allowed during that 
time. See the reasoning under "Added rule 6.1.4.2" for further reasoning.*

* **Changed rule 6.2.1.1 from:**
```
6.2.1.1	Matches should be played on Chicago servers by default, unless both teams agree on another server location.
```
to:
```
6.2.1.1 Matches should be played on the server with the lowest ping difference between the highest and lowest ping 
        player in a lobby. This is calculated by subtracting the highest player’s ping with the lowest player’s ping.
```
*Reason: This change was made to somewhat resolve ping issues for players who live on either ends of the West or East 
coast of the United States.* 

* **Changed rule 6.2.6 from:**
```
6.2.6	If Allow Cheats is left on and a team misuses any part of it, whether intentional or not, the map will be 
        forfeited 0-13. Player stats will not be recorded.
```
to:
```
6.2.6	If Allow Cheats is left on and a team misuses any part of it, whether intentional or not, the map will be 
        forfeited 0-0 with the win going to the non-offending team. Player stats will not be recorded.
```
*Reason: Teams who receive a forfeit win will not receive a +13 round differential for tiebreaker purposes in order to 
keep the tiebreakers fair.*

* **Changed rule 6.3.3 and 6.3.3.1 from:**
```
6.3.3	For Playoff matches, games beyond the first game have a break period of up to 10 minutes.
6.3.3.1	If all 5 players on a team are not ready after 10 minutes, the captain or acting captain of the team should 
        send the opposing captain a DM. If all players are not ready 5 minutes after the captain is alerted, 
        the map will be forfeited.
```
to:
```
6.3.3	For Playoff matches, players may request a break period of up to 10 minutes, but will otherwise be given a 
        maximum of 5 minutes.
6.3.3.1	If all 5 players on a team are not ready after 5 minutes (or 10 minutes if that break was agreed upon), the 
        other team should be sent a 5 minute warning. If all players are not ready 5 minutes after the other team is 
        alerted, the map will be forfeited.
```
*Reason: Breaks were shortened during playoffs to speed up BO5 and BO3 matches. Teams who need the additional time can 
still request to do so, however. Additionally, since acting captains were removed, the rule was updated to specify that 
the other team should be aware of their forfeit timer starting before a forfeit takes place.*

* **Changed rule 6.4.2 from:**
```
6.4.2	Examples of actions that are not allowed include, but are not limited to, the following:
        - Moving on, under, or through any areas that are not intended by the map design (any walls, ceilings, floors, etc).
        - Placing the spike in an area it can not be defused, or in an area where the Spike does not behave as intended. However, 
          it is okay to use Sage walls to block the bomb or secure it in a certain area (such as in the cubby on Icebox B site).
        - Boosting on top of teammates is not allowed when it allows players to see through solid objects or remove textures to gain an unfair advantage. Boosting on top of a teammate is otherwise allowed.
        - Pixel walking. A player will be considered to be pixel walking if they sit or stand on invisible pixels on the map, such as using Jett updrafts to land on a high up invisible ledge

```
to:
```
6.4.2	Examples of actions that are not allowed include, but are not limited to, the following:
        - Moving on, under, or through any areas that are not intended by the map design (any walls, ceilings, floors, etc).
        - Using an exploit or glitch to plant or place the spike in an area that gives an unfair advantage. However, it is okay to use Sage walls to block the bomb or secure it in a certain area (such as in the cubby on Icebox B site).
        - Boosting on top of teammates is not allowed when it allows players to see through solid objects or remove textures to gain an unfair advantage. Boosting on top of a teammate is otherwise allowed.
        - Pixel walking. A player will be considered to be pixel walking if they sit or stand on invisible pixels on the map, such as using Jett updrafts to land on a high up invisible ledge
        - All Cypher cam placements that afford an unfair competitive advantage via abusing map textures and/or geometry to prevent the Cypher cam from being destroyed or seen are considered banned exploits. All Cypher cam placements must result in a Cypher cam that is destructible, that is viewable by both teams, and that does not exploit map textures and/or geometry to create a one-way view that provides an unfair advantage. Any other uses of a Cypher cam that are determined by the VDC admin team to provide an unfair competitive advantage will also be considered banned exploits.
        - All uses of agent utility that afford an unfair competitive advantage via abusing map textures and/or geometry to prevent the agent utility from being destroyed or seen are considered banned exploits. Agent utility cannot be used in areas that are outside of map boundaries while potentially providing any useful information or advantage at any point. Areas that are within map boundaries are defined as areas where all utility is (1) destructible as intended for that utility, (2) has the ability to be seen by both teams as intended for that utility, and (3) does not exploit map texture and/or geometry to provide an unfair competitive advantage. 
        - A player shall not alter the utility’s intended purpose and scope of usage by abusing map textures and/or geometry, abusing unintended interactions with other utility, unintended interactions with weapons, or other types of unintended interactions to gain an unfair competitive advantage. Any other uses of an agent's utility that are determined by the VDC admin team to provide an unfair competitive advantage will also be considered banned exploits. 
        - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS: KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability is intended to be usable outside of map boundaries, and is a special exception regarding these rules. KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability is allowed to be placed outside of map boundaries, and at other locations that cause KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability to be indestructible and/or unviewable by the enemy players. However, the knife model of KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability cannot abuse or exploit map textures and/or geometry to travel to unintended locations. For example, the knife model of KAY/O's ZERO/POINT ability may not travel through or inside map textures and/or geometry that are intended to be solid. Teams should clear specific trajectories or end locations for KAYO's ZERO/POINT ability with VDC Admins prior to usage if the Team is unsure whether that usage complies with this special exception rule.

```
*Reason: This rule update provides official clarification on bugs and exploits straight from Riot. The wording of 
"tournament official" has been replaced with "VDC admin team" or something similar.*

* **Changed rule 6.5.1 from:**
```
6.5.1	If a player disconnects mid-game, they are allowed to join back as soon as possible.
```
to:
```
6.5.1	If a player disconnects mid-game, they are allowed to join back as soon as possible. If players are unable to 
        reconnect to the game, contact an admin and the match will be restored to the best of our ability.
```
*Reason: This has happened before during an official VDC match, and a process was not described in the previous 
rulebook for dealing with the situation.*

* **Changed rules 6.5.2.1 and 6.5.2.2 from:**
```
6.5.2.1	Teams are allowed to pause for technical issues 2 times per match night. Each pause may, but is not required 
        to, last up to 10 minutes. If the first tech pause goes over 10 minutes, the team loses their right to a second 
        tech pause. Any pauses not used during the first map may be used during map 2.
6.5.2.2	If the tech issue has not been solved 9 minutes after the pause begins, your captain should warn the opponents in the game chat that they have 1 minute remaining. After this minute passes, the team will begin using their second allotted technical timeout. After 19 minutes, a second 1 minute warning should be given, after which the match may be unpaused whether or not the issue is resolved. Further unreasonable delay may result in a match forfeit.

```
to:
```
6.5.2.1	Teams are allowed to pause for technical issues. All pauses may, but are not required to, last up to a total of 
        20 minutes per match day. 
6.5.2.2	If the combined total of technical pauses reaches 15 minutes during a match day, the pausing team should be 
        given a 5 minute warning. If the combined total reaches 19 minutes, the pausing team should be given a 1 minute 
        warning. Any further delay of technical pauses past the 20 minute mark may result in a forfeit for the pausing 
        team.
```
*Reason: Teams should be allowed to pause as often as they need to resolve any issues relating to technology. If the 
opposing team feels that their opponent is abusing technical pauses, it is still their responsibility to keep track of 
the time paused.*

* **Changed rule 8.2.1 from:**
```
8.2.1	The waiver order is determined by tier, not the league as a whole.
```
to:
```
8.2.1	The waiver order is determined by the inverse of team standings within a tier, with the worst team in a tier 
        getting the first waiver claim and the best team in a tier getting the last waiver claim.
```
*Reason: Combined rules 8.2.1 and old 8.2.2.*

* **Changed rules 8.3.1, 8.3.1.2, and 12.1.2.1 from:**
```
8.3.1	  Waiver periods for players end every Tuesday at Noon EST and Thursday at Noon EST.
8.3.1.1	  If a player is cut between Friday and Tuesday, their waiver will end on the coming Thursday.
12.1.2.1  A replacement player must be submitted 24 hours prior to the end of their waiver period. This will either 
          be a Monday or Wednesday at 11:59pm EST.
```
to:
```
8.3.1	  Waiver periods for players end every Noon EST the day before each match day.
8.3.1.1	  If a player is placed on waivers, their waiver period will end after one week.
12.1.2.1  A replacement player must be submitted 24 hours prior to the end of their waiver period.
```
*Reason: This rule update allows for match days to be changed without having to update these rules in the future. It also 
provides some much, much needed clarity and standardizes the waiver period per-player.*

* **Changed rule 10.2.1.2 from:**
```
10.2.1.2	If a Free Agent/RFA no-shows to a match they agreed to substitute in, without a valid reason, they will be 
            barred from subbing for up to 4 match days.
```
to:
```
10.2.1.2	If a Free Agent/RFA no-shows to a match they agreed to substitute in, without a valid reason, they will be 
            barred from subbing for up to 2 match days. Repeated infractions will result in further match day 
            punishments or a full season ban.
```
*Reason: A sliding scale of punishments for subs who no-show would be more appropriate for first-time offenders, while 
repeat offenders can still get increasingly larger punishments for repeated infractions.*

* **Changed rule 13.2.3 from:**
```
13.2.3	A sign and promote transaction will not be available if the transaction would leave less than 1 non-restricted 
        Free Agent per team in the tier they are promoted from.
```
to:
````
13.2.3	A sign and promote transaction will not be available if the transaction would eliminate every available 
        substitute who can be subbed within an MMR bracket from the lower tier. For example, the transaction would not 
        be valid if it removed every tier-minimum substitute that is available within the tier.
````
*Reason: Ideally, a season would not start if teams weren't able to pull from lower tiers without decimating the Free 
Agent count in the tier. This new rule removes the restriction of signing and promoting players from lower tiers while 
also not detracting too much from the lower tier's available subs.*

* **Changed rule 16.1.1.4 from:**
```
16.1.1.4	(Optional) GM 1v1 on a game of their choice
```
to:
```
16.1.1.4	(Optional) BO1 Series
```
*Reason: With great sadness, we are here to announce the death of the optional GM 1v1 to decide a tiebreaker. Instead, 
if possible and both teams are willing, a BO1 series can be used to dissolve a tie.*

* **Changed rules 17.2.2 and 17.2.3 from:**
```
17.2.2	With 10, 12, or 14 teams, there will be a 6 team playoff. Seeds 1 and 2 get a bye.
17.2.3	With 16, 18, or 20 teams, there will be an 8 team playoff.
```
to:
```
17.2.2	With 10 or 12 teams, there will be a 6 team playoff. Seeds 1 and 2 get a bye.
17.2.3	With 14 or 16 teams, there will be an 8 team playoff.
```
*Reason: Moving a 14 team tier to a BO8 playoff is more fair because more teams will have an incentive to play in 
matches towards the end of the season. For rules regarding tiers with an odd number of teams or over 16 teams, please 
refer to "Added rule 17.2.4".*

## Removed
 * **Removed rules 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2:**
```
1.1 VDC: Explained
1.1.1   Valorant Draft Circuit (VDC) is a different kind of Valorant experience: a league designed to operate like a
        professional sports league. General Managers draft players, make trades, set rosters, and compete to be the 
        powerhouse that every team strives to beat the following season.
1.1.2   Our ultimate goal is to create a friendly environment for people to play competitive Valorant, regardless 
        of their skill level.
```
*Reason: This text was unneeded and will be replaced by the mission statement on the website.*

* **Removed rule 2.2.2.4:**
```
2.2.2.4	A GM can not substitute in a higher tier if they are not a part of a roster in their franchise.
```
*Reason: This rule was merged with rule 2.2.2.3.*

* **Removed rule 4.3.1.2:**
```
4.3.1.2	Players on IR will need to be drafted with a keeper pick.
```
*Reason: Players are removed from Inactive Reserve after each season according to new rule 3.1.3.4, making this rule 
obsolete.*

* **Removed 6.5.2.3:**
```
6.5.2.3	Tech pauses during streamed matches may last the duration of two tech pauses consecutively for each map. If the 
pause is longer than 2 tech pauses, the match will continue without the stream issue being resolved.
```
*Reason: With the new rules pertaining to tech pauses during a streamed match, players can unpause whenever they like, 
so a rule about streamed technical pause time is not needed.*

* **Removed rule 6.6.2:**
```
6.6.2	For the purpose of resolving ties, any overtime result will be counted as a 14-12 score.
```
*Reason: This hasn't been done across any season of VDC since this was added to the rulebook.*

* **Removed rule 8.3.1.2:**
```
8.3.1.2	If a player is cut on a Wednesday or Thursday, their waiver will end on the following Tuesday.
```
*Reason: Unnecessary with new 8.3.1.1 explanation of waivers.*

* **Removed rule 10.1.2.1**
```
10.1.2.1  Teams in higher tiers may not look for a substitute from a lower tier until 2 hours before the match is 
          scheduled to begin.
```
*Reason: Teams who are restricted by the MMR cap should be able to field from lower tiers as soon as possible to 
confirm that player's availability. Additionally, this rule hasn't been enforced.*
